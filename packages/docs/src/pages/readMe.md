# mEditor

## Getting Started

-   Clone the repo and `cd meditor`
-   Copy .env.example, create a **new file** called .env
-   mEditor uses Earthdata Login for authentication, so you will need to update `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in your .env with the values for your client application.
-   Build and run the app: `docker-compose up`
    -   NOTE: you will see a warning about REGISTRY variable is not set. You can safely ignore this. If you'd like to use a private registry you can set this ENV variable.
-   Once everything is up and running (may take a few minutes on the first run), you can access mEditor at: `http://localhost/meditor`
-   The first time you load mEditor, it will take you through a step-by-step for setting up the database and initial users.

## Developing in mEditor

-   In development, you can make changes in most of the service folders and the service will restart with your changes applied.
-   Out of the box, your IDE will show errors for dependencies and will be missing autocompletion for dependencies. This is due to Docker installing dependencies inside the container, inaccessible to the host. To fix this, you can run `npm install` inside whichever service folder you are working on.
-   Please create a branch for your changes and when you are finished, create a pull request to have them reviewed and merged in.

## Subscribing to document state changes

When a document in mEditor moves through a workflow (ex. moves to Draft, moves to Published, etc.), mEditor puts that document into a queue (NATS) that can be subscribed to by an external service.

A queue is created for each model. For example, documents in the `Example News` model would be pushed to the `meditor-Example-News` queue.

A document in the queue will look similar to this example:

```json
{
    "id": "",
    "document": {...},
    "model": {...},
    "target": "example",            # (optional) if included, this message is only meant for a certain subscriber
    "state": "Under Review",
    "time": 1580324162703
}
```

The clients are expected to publish an acknowledgement message into the 'meditor-Acknowledgement' queue, with this form:

```json
{
    "time": 1580324162703,
    "id": "",                       # the document ID, send this back so mEditor knows which document to update
    "model": "Example News",        # the model namm
    "target": "example",            # the website/application that handled the document
    "url": "https://example.nasa.gov/news?title=Example%20article",     # an optional URL the document was published to
    "message": "Success!",          # a message to show the user in mEditor (could include a list of errors for failures)
    "statusCode": "200",            # status code to notify mEditor of success vs failure to publish
    "state": "Under Review"
}
```

An example subscriber is located in `./examples/subscriber` and shows how to subscribe to a specific model and how to send acknowledgements back to mEditor.

The built-in notifier, which sends emails to users, is also a subscriber. The notifier subscribes to the `meditor-notifications` queue.

**Note:**

If mEditor is embedded in another application and you'd like to redirect back to the application after a document has been published: include `"redirectToUrl": true` in the acknowledgement message

There is an example of this redirect in examples/subscriber-with-redirect

## Themes

mEditor will change parts of its user interface based on the current theme. The theme defaults to "default" and can be adjusted to other values through the URL query parameter `theme` or the environment variable `UI_THEME`. Available themes are listed in the file `_app.tsx` under the `THEMES` constant.

### Conflict Resolution

In case of a conflict between an allowed value for the `theme` URL query param, and the environment variable `UI_THEME`, the URL query param wins. Because the URL query param requires allow-listing a value before use (via the `UI_ALLOWED_URL_THEME` environment variable), it can be disabled at the environment variable level (by removing it or changing its value) to allow `UI_THEME` to take precedence. These environment variables allows mEditor to switch, enable, or disable themes without redeployment.

### URL Query Parameters

To be enabled via a URL query param, a theme must first be allow-listed through the environment variable `UI_ALLOWED_URL_THEME`, which should be set to an available theme.

#### Example Usage

Set the allowed theme.

```bash
echo 'UI_ALLOWED_URL_THEME=EDPub' >> ./.env
```

`http://localhost/meditor?theme=EDPub` or `http://localhost/meditor?theme=edpub` will enable mEditor's EDPub theme.

### `UI_THEME` Environment Variable

To be set the theme via the `UI_THEME` environment variable, set the variable's value to an avaiable theme.

#### Example Usage

Set the allowed theme.

```bash
echo 'UI_THEME=EDPub' >> ./.env
```

The theme is now set. If you also have `UI_ALLOWED_URL_THEME` set, please note Themes' Conflict Resolution section.

## Authentication

mEditor allows a user to log in through its user interface or through a POST request to its login endpoint. Earthdata Login and AWS Cognito are both supported for login through the UI. This guide assumes that you know how to set up AWS Cognito for login through the UI.

### Login through UI

To learn more about logging in through mEditor's UI, see [Logging In](https://github.com/nasa/gesdisc-meditor/blob/main/packages/docs/docs/user-guide/quick-start.mdx) within the User Guide.

### Login through API

mEditor currently supports two authentication services, [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) and [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation).

#### AWS Cognito

To log in through mEditor's API, first (and only once) set up a new AWS Cognito App Client within your existing User Pool. Set the environment variable `COGNITO_INITIATE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` to the value of this new Cognito Client ID.

-   Ensure that `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` is enabled in your Authentication Flow.
-   Ensure no client secret is set for the App Client.

Send a POST request to `meditor/api/login` similar to this:

```sh
curl -v -X POST 'localhost/meditor/api/login' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{ "username": "your-username", "password": "your-password" }'
```

The API will send back a reply with either an error or user, and a `set-cookie` header containing a session cookie. If the API response contained a user, that user is now logged in and can interact with the API when requests contain the session cookie. E.g.,

```sh
curl -X POST 'localhost/meditor/api/cloneDocument?model=Example%20News&title=Lorem%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet&newTitle=New%20Document' \
     -H 'Cookie: __mEditor=s%3AlxPdaElW5qwzWlDiWmQFPYHFGt5k9U5w.qSei3cxoV3Yj4F9KnBaA7wZMXAC3%2FelBcM7UuMjgPfE'
```

Please note that the mEditor API will optimistically establish a session and sends a `set-cookie` header for every request that doesn't include a `Cookie` header with a `__mEditor` cookie. That optimistically-established session will not be tied to an authenticated user through the API.

To check the status of your existing session, send the following request:

```sh
curl -X GET 'localhost/meditor/api/me' \
     -H 'Cookie: __mEditor=s%3A97VTrwKZklddMtoZu__qwmAs6kavLYcX.UPa8esHs9kpCbyEWFLrn6LBIv9yqgeSim5bTQLR9cfM'
```

A user will be returned if your session is still active.

#### Earthdata Login

To log in through the mEditor API, you'll need to send a curl request to mEditor's login endpoint. The example below assumes that you have a `.netrc` file set up with your Earthdata Login (EDL) credentials. If you don't, general information on `.netrc` can be found in [cURL's documentation](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc), and EDL-specific `.netrc` information can be found in the first part of Earthdata Login's documentation on [How To Access Data With cURL And Wget](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/data_access/curl_and_wget). After your `.netrc` is configured, you can log in through mEditor's API with the following command:

```sh
curl -b ~/.urs_cookies -c ~/.urs_cookies  -L -n http://localhost/meditor/api/login > /dev/null
```

You can then interact with the API via cURL as in the following example:

```sh
curl -b ~/.urs_cookies -c ~/.urs_cookies -L -n -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @./upload.json http://localhost/meditor/api/models/{some-model}/documents
```
