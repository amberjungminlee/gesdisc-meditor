## JSON Patch

The [Bulk Documents] endpoint uses the [JSON Patch specification](https://jsonpatch.com/).

This specification describes a set of instruction on how to modify a resource.

### Identifying documents to update

The bulk documents endpoint requires the inclusion of an `If-Match` headers, which is a comma-delimited list of the document titles to update.

For example, to edit three documents, titled "A", "B", and "C", you would include the following header with your request:

`If-Match: "A", "B", "C"`

### Operations Syntax

mEditor supports all of the supported JSON Patch operations found in the specification linked above.

Additionally, you can include as many operations as you want in one request.

Each operation object in the request body consists of 3 main attributes:
[0] op — indicates the operation to perform. As per the specification, its value MUST be one of “add”, “remove”, “replace”, “move”, “copy”, or “test”
[1] path — string containing a JSON-Pointer value that references the “target location” where the operation is performed
[2] value — data to be operated for the given path

#### "add"

Adds a value to an object or inserts it into an array. In the case of an array, the value is inserted before the given index. The - character can be used instead of an index to insert at the end of an array.

Example, add a "Science Keyword" to many collections at once:

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "add", "path": "/Science_Keywords/-", "value": "EARTH SCIENCE > ATMOSPHERE > PRECIPITATION" }
]
```

#### "remove"

Removes a value from an object or array.

Example: Remove the `Dataset_Progress` field from a list of collections

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "remove", "path": "/Dataset_Progress" }
]
```

#### "replace"

Replaces a value. Equivalent to a “remove” followed by an “add”.

Example: Replace the `Dataset_Progress` field in a list of collections

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/Dataset_Progress", "value": "COMPLETE" }
]
```

#### "copy"

Copies a value from one location to another within the JSON document. Both from and path are JSON Pointers.

Example, renaming a field, copy the old field to the new field:

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "copy", "from": "/Dataset_Version", "path": "/Version" }
]
```

#### "move"

Moves a value from one location to the other. Both from and path are JSON Pointers.

Example, same as above. Rename a field, though this time the old field is removed.

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "move", "from": "/Dataset_Version", "path": "/Version" }
]
```

#### "test"

Tests that the specified value is set in the document. If the test fails, then the patch as a whole should not apply.

```
If-Match: "GPM_3IMERGHH_06", "GPM_3IMERGHH_07"

[
    { "op": "test", "path": "/AwsEnabled", "value": true },
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/Region", "value": "us-east-1" }
]
```
