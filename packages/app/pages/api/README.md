# mEditor RESTful API

API routes should use [REST conventions](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/).

For mEditor, this would follow this structure: /models/{modelName}/documents/{documentTitle}

## Old API Redirects

The old API can be found in the `legacy-endpoints` folder. Each old API route is mapped to one of these endpoints in `next.config.js`.
